# mySQLTeamTracker

## Description

This Team Tracker was created as an exercise in MySQL db CRUD functionality, allowing for users to view and manage a team with a variety of relationships.
The main issue was with writing the MySQL code, as it's very finnicky in how it is written and little things can easily break your code. It also allowed for
further work with Object Oriented Programming, which allowed for a deeper familiarity with the technology.


## Installation

This App requires the installation of the MySQL Shell and Node.js. Instructions on their installation can be found on their respective websites.

In the command line, run 'npm install'
Then open the MySQL shell and run: 'SOURCE ./db/schema.sql;'
